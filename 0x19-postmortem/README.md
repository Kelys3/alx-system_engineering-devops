Postmortem: Network Issues and System Downtime 

Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: 2023-07-15 08:00 AM UTC
End Time: 2023-07-15 10:30 AM UTC
Impact:
Widespread network issues resulted in a complete system downtime.
Users experienced an inability to access the website during the outage, affecting 80% of the user base.

Root Cause:

The root cause of the incident was identified as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack targeting the network infrastructure.

Timeline:

Detection:
2023-07-15 08:00 AM UTC: An automated monitoring system triggered alerts on a sudden increase in incoming traffic and server load.
Simultaneous user reports of the website being inaccessible were received through customer support channels.
Actions Taken:
2023-07-15 08:15 AM UTC: Initial investigation focused on server logs and network traffic patterns.
Assumed a potential server misconfiguration and initiated troubleshooting steps.
Misleading Paths:
Explored potential hardware failures in the server infrastructure due to the observed high server load.
Investigated recent software updates for unintended consequences on system stability.
Escalation:
2023-07-15 09:00 AM UTC: Escalated the incident to the network and security teams for a joint investigation.
Collaboration involved system administrators, network engineers, and cybersecurity experts.
Resolution:
2023-07-15 10:30 AM UTC: Identified the DDoS attack as the primary cause of the network issues.
Mitigated the attack by rerouting traffic through a DDoS protection service.
Implemented additional security measures to filter and block malicious traffic.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The DDoS attack overwhelmed the network infrastructure, leading to degraded performance and eventual system downtime.
The attack exploited vulnerabilities in the network's traffic filtering mechanisms.
Resolution:
Implemented DDoS mitigation measures, including traffic rerouting and increased filtering capabilities.
Conducted a thorough security audit to identify and patch vulnerabilities in the network architecture.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Strengthen DDoS protection measures by investing in advanced traffic analysis and filtering technologies.
Enhance monitoring to quickly identify and respond to abnormal traffic patterns.
Tasks:
Conduct regular security audits to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure.
Develop and test incident response procedures to streamline collaboration among various teams during network-related incidents.
Educate stakeholders and users on recognizing and reporting potential security threats.
