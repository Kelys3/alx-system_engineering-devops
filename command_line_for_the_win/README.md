# Command line for the win

``CMD CHALLENGE`` is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!

## Process To Transfer Screenshots from Windows Desktop to Terminal using SFTP
* First create a folder on pc desktop and transfer ``screenshots`` into it.
* I saved the ``screenshots`` in ``png`` format
* Open ``command prompt`` and navigate to the path where the ``screenshots`` have been saved
* Use the ``SFTP command-line tool`` to establish a connection to the sandbox environment.
  You will need the ``hostname``, ``username``, and ``password`` provided to you for the sandbox
  environment.
* I used the command cd to access the path where the ``screenshots`` will be saved in my sandbox. i.e ``/root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/``
* Use the SFTP ``put`` command to upload the ``screenshots`` from your local machine to the
  sandbox environment
* Confirm that the ``screenshots`` have been successfully transferred by checking the
  sandbox directory.
